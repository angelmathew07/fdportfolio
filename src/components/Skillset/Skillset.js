            <h2>About</h2>
            <span>
            I originally hail from a little place called Kerala in India,  and for the last few years, I‚Äôve been in Canada. 
            Before Bell, I did Master of Engineering degree in Inter-networking at Dalhousie University (Dal), Halifax. 
            Besides my studies at Dal, I also worked as a Python Lab assistant, helping students with Python language, Flask framework, and Git version control.

            I have  4+ years of experience in front-end development, where I specialize in translating UX mockups into responsive interfaces that work seamlessly across any device. 
            I also occasionally design user experiences to high-fidelity prototypes.
            My interest in web development started in  last years of my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science Engineering. 
            Soon after graduation I started my career at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India  as a front-end developer and worked on web applications using AngularJS, Angular, HTML5 CSS3, JavaScript. 
            </span>
            <span>Apart from UI/UX, I have an interest in full-stack development, in particular, I enjoy coding in Python.</span>
            <br></br>
            <span>In my off time, you will find me cooking, working out, or watching adorable animal videos( especially  üê∂ üê± üê∞ ).</span>
